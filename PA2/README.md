Pt1. MazeworldProblem & A* Search
1. For running my code, if need to run provided test only, you can comment out tests I wrote under "line 29: # Your additional tests here:" 
2. There are 5 additional test cases in test_mazeworld.py, the results are stored into according files named in the format of test_case_N_output.txt, the maze are stored in maze_test_case_N.maz files
3. The reason why I choose those 5 test case are in the comments of those 5 test cases
4. Due to case 3 and 4 are randomly generated, there are chances that maze with no avilable path or generated or extremely complex maze are generated so that takes very long run time
5. manhattan_heuristic is in Mazeworldproblem.py

6. you can directly run test_sensorless.py to test my code. Apart from Maze3, I used two new mazes named maze_test_case_N.maz (case 6 and 7) to test my code following the instruction from write up, using a 6*6 and a 7*7 maze. The results screen shot for the two addtional test case are stored in CaseNResult.png named files
7. blind_heuristic is in test_sensorless.py
